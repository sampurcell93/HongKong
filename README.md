## Going to Hong Kong
This is the public repository for the creative presentation of my trip to Hong Kong. People thrive on shared experience, and I'm no exception; I'd love for people to know what I'm getting up to. The difference is that I can't stand reading peoples' travel blogs - they just get too personal and reek of amateurish writing - so I think I'll spare you my probably-cringe-worthy diary entries. Instead, enjoy a bag of bite sized experiences, presented so that your distracted brain can return to Buzzfeed as soon as possible.

## The code
I'm going to write this as a JQuery plugin for scrolling through a story. Time to brainstorm. Look for more later.
